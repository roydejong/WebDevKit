# WebDevKit

> **WebDevKit is a site manager for web developers on Windows that makes setting up development sites a breeze.
> Nginx, PHP and MySQL with zero configuration.**

:warning: **Important:** This project is still under development and is not ready to use at all. It's being built. Like, it doesn't even work a little bit. It's more of a playground right now.

Technical information
---
This application is written in JavaScript using Node.js and is built on top of [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) (formerly known as Atom Shell). It is, in theory, a cross-platform application but it is currently aimed at Windows only.

In order to get the program up and running, you'll need `npm` (the Node.js package manager) installed on your system. Then, after checking out the project, just issue these commands:

    npm install
    npm start

This should result in the dependencies being installed, and the Electron app starting. That's all, folks.
