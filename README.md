> **WebDevKit is a site manager for web developers on Windows that makes setting up development sites a breeze.
> Nginx, PHP and MySQL with zero configuration.**

:warning: **Important:** This project is still under development and is not ready to use at all. It's being built. Like, it doesn't even work a little bit. It's more of a playground right now.
